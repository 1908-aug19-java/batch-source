        <p>Mountains are so simple, they're hard. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Here we're limited by the time we have. You can do anything your heart can imagine.</p>

<p class="formatted-par">You gotta think like a tree. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.</p>

<p>Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Look at them little rascals. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.</p>

<p class="formatted-par">Very easy to work these to death. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.</p>

<p>Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We'll put a happy little sky in here. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's have a nice tree right here.</p>

<p>There are no limits in this world. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Don't fiddle with it all day. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds.</p>
