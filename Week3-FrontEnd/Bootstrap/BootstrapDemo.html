        <p class="text-center text-primary">Mountains are so simple, they're hard. In your imagination you can go
            anywhere you want. Here we're limited
            by the
            time we have. You can do anything your heart can imagine.</p>

        <p class="text-right text-danger">You gotta think like a tree. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to
            resist
            these
            things. Just let them happen. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt
            anyone.
            The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.</p>

        <p class="text-nowrap text-warning">Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Look at
            them little rascals. Talk to
            trees, look
            at the birds. Whatever it takes. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.</p>

        <p class="text-justify text-info">Very easy to work these to death. Anytime you learn something your time and
            energy are
            not
            wasted. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of
            Prussian
            Blue. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Use absolutely no
            pressure.
            Just like an angel's wing.</p>

        <p class="text-success">Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We'll put a happy little
            sky in here. I spend
            a lot of
            time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let's
            have a
            nice tree right here.</p>

        <p>There are no limits in this world. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Don't kill all your dark
            areas - you
            need them to show the light. Don't fiddle with it all day. Making all those little fluffies that live in the
            clouds.

            <p class="col-md-8">I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. See there, told you that would be easy. It is a lot of fun. We'll do another happy little painting. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>
            <p class="col-md-4">You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.</p>
