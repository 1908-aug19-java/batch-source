       <h1>Kaylan Husband</h1>
           <div id = "firstDiv">
               <p5>My name is Kaylan. I graduated back in May with a degree in math but i've always had a love for programming. I have a high technical aptitude and great ability to think on my feet, understand new information, and adapt to new environments.
                I am originally from the United States Virgin Islands. Many people would never even guess it, or maybe not even know where that is. Still, I am a big thinker and I believe that is why I am where I am. So far in this training I have learned quite alot and have taken an in-depth look at Java, sql and how the two communicate.
                   I look forward to becoming the best programmer I can be while working for Revature. Also I like the Lakers (Even though they traded my boy Lonzo).</p5>
