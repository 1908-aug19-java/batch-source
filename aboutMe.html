                <p>Michael Zhang: Graduated in 2019 from UIUC with a degree in Electrical Engineering. Focused primarily in semiconductors as well as antennaes.</p>

                <p>My most comfortable language would have to be C/C++ followed significantly behind by Python. Throughout all of school, I had used C/C++ to complete assignments and labs and have naturally grown comfortable and used to the language. Additionally, I am also competent in x86 assembly. I have written machine language as literal bits and hex as well as other assembly languages.</p>

                <p>I am deeply invested into both music and gaming. When asked on what style or genre of music I enjoy most, I cannot give a coherant response. I enjoy it based on my personal response to the medium, though, that being said, I am still a classically trained pianist and have a predilection towards the classical and romantic eras.</p>

                <p>Most likely the first thing that others notice is that I am rather soft-spoken and introspective. Though it might seem arrogant, I like to believe that I am an honest if not blunt person given a natural setting. Otherwise, adjusting towards a given scenario or mood is not very difficult for me.</p>
                <p>Even with these traits, I am still deeply competative. Even with the most mundane of tasks, I still strive to do my best or at least go beyond the scope of what others are doing. Call it what you will, competative flair or simply being too self-conscious, it is what it is.</p>
                <p>I like to believe that I am also a fairly patient person. Though I like to banter and engage in that sort of talk, I am rarely quick to actually anger. I am also comfortable enought with myself where I can enjoy activites on my lonesome.</p>

            <div class = "col">

                <p>Personally, I believe that my work ethic is rather poor in terms of consistency over the course of a given track. Historically in both work and schooling, I prefer to finish off the bulk of my given work and duties as soon as they are assigned. Thus, over the course of the track, my contribution decreases day by day until I believe that I have acted sufficiently and have a product that satisfies my own criterion.</p>

                <p>That being said, I also do not wish to deliver an unfinished project or assignment. Thus, historically, I have taken over other responsibilities that my coworkers or collegues should have taken. This has been the case both in terms of my schooling as well as my work.</p>

                <p>As stated prior, I am a classically trained pianist; however, I have also played violin for a number of years as well as composed some of my own works. I also transcript pieces on request.</p>
